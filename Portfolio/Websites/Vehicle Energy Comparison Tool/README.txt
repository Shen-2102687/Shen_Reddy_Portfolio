This website is an energy comparison tool that can compare
the energy usage between a few select petrol vehicles and the average
electric vehicle alternative.

The website was created in collaboration with other members. Their names and contributions
are detailed in the repo link provided. For this project I handled system design and implementation
for the energy and price comparisons. I also handled the UI and Chart system generation.
