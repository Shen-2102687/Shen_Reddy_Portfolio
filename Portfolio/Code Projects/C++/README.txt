The project demonstrates a dynamically generated and automated game of Snakes and Ladders.

The game is run using the console of any IDE that can compile and run C++ code.

The program uses a provided input file to generate an output file(labelled "results.txt")
containing the results of the game.

To play the game, run the .cpp file provided as explained earlier, however, ensure
that the provided input.txt file is contained within the same folder as the .cpp file,
otherwise the program will not work correctly.

Once the program has run and ended, the results file will be generated in the same folder,
which will detail the events and final results of the game.

Note, no user input is required to run/play the game.

The ouput file contains the following information:
-	The Round Number (R)
-	The Player Number (P)
-	The Die Roll Number (D)
-	The Playerâ€™s New Position (M)
-	The Ladder Position (L)
-	The Snake Tail Position (S)
-	The Winning Player (wP)
-	End Condition (D) if players end in a draw
The output file will provide this information as a new line for each round until the game ends.

A report has been provided, detailing the development of the project, as well as other specifics
such as analysis of results, play instructions, and a flow chart detailing the system logic.
