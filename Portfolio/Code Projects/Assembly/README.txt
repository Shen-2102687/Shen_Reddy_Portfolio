This project is a Number Game built as a circuit device using assembly programming language,
an ATMEGA328p Microprocessor and other circuit components.

The Assembly code for this project has been provided, along with a report of the project
development, an image of the final device as well as a video to showcase the functionality.

Detailed functionality and parameters are given in the report. A brief summary of the game
is given below.

The device runs a program as follows:

-Numbers are shown to the user on the 7seg LED
-The user must determine if the sum of all the shown numbers since their last press
is divisble by 3, if so then they must press the button.
-A correct answer will flash a green light and an incorrect one will flash red.
